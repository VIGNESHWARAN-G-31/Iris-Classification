# 🌸 Iris Classification Project 🌿

Welcome to the **Iris Classification Project!** This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in classifying iris flower species using three popular algorithms: **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Decision Tree**. 🌼

## 📚 Overview

The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, consists of 150 samples of iris flowers belonging to three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Each sample has four features:  
- **Sepal Length** 🌱  
- **Sepal Width** 🌺  
- **Petal Length** 🌷  
- **Petal Width** 🌼  

Our goal is to accurately classify these species based on their features, showcasing the capabilities of different machine learning algorithms!

## ⚙️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and visualize the dataset for better understanding.
- **Model Training**: Implement and train three algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression 📈
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 📏
  - Decision Tree 🌳
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of each model using accuracy metrics and visualizations.
